# android-fancygallery
An Android app built in Kotlin to display a gallery of photos, and their marked locations on a world map. 

**Key Techniques Used:**
- API to retrieve images from Flickr
- Activities, ViewModels, LifecycleOwners, CoroutineScopes, and bindings for handling data.
- A customized MapView with markers and controls for displaying retrieved photos on a world map (if coordinates provided in API response). 
- WebViews with WebChromeClient to show the linked webpages of the retrieved images in views within the app

Built for my Mobile App Development course, taken for my MEng CSA degree at Virginia Tech (Fall 2024)
